# Daily-project
I have been self-learning front-end web developing since sep/2018, and so far so good. I don't have any coding and IT related experience before, I am a compeleted new guy here. Github is very good place to improve, to learn, to communicate and to motivate myself. I have a long way to go, and I will stick with here to see how actually far I can go!!

I will start this project called daily-project which I will try my best to do a project every day. whatever it is a big or small one, cause I think this will help me to improve and prevent to forget old stuff when I learn the new thing.

let's see how will go!
